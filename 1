Added default model

Moved api logic to a default model - this can be overridden by supplying a custom Model on init. Model must have a `fetch` method which returns a promise, resolving with returned data, rejecting on error. A custom validate method can also be defined which returns a promise, resolving on validation success, rejecting on validation error
